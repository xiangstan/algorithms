# Homework 7 Scheduling Compatible Intervals
# 
# Author: Xiang Shan Tan
#
# This program contains three different implementations of the Scheduling Compatible Intervals.
#   Earliest start first,
#   Shortest duration first,
#   Earliest finish first
#
# Ths sample jobs are (start time, end time): [(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 5)]
