## Lognest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph

A **Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG) is a conceptual representation of a series of activities. The order of the activities is depicted by a graph, which is visually presented as a set of circles, each one representing an activity, some of which are connected by lines, which represent the flow from one activity to another.

Design an efficient algorithm for finding the length of the longest path in a dag. 

This problem is important both as a prototype of many other dynamic programming applications and in its own right because it determines the minimal time needed for completing a project comprising precedenceconstrained tasks.
