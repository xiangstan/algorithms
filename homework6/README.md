# Dynamic Programming

This homework contains two parts related to Dynamic Programming.

1. Coin-collecting Problem
1. Edit Distance Problem

## Coin-Collecting Problem

Design an algorithm to compute the maximum coins a robot can collect from a board. The board contains several coin and inaccessible squares located in random spots. The robot can only move either to the right or down.

## Edit Distance Problem

The words computer and commenter are very similar, and a change of just one letter, p to m will change the first word into the second. The word sport can be changed into sort by deleting p, or sort can be changed into short just by inserting h.

The eid tdistance of two strings s1 and s2 is defined as the minimum number of character mutations required to chage s1 into s2., where a nutation is one of

1. chage a letter,
1. insert a letter, or
1. delete a letter.

Develop a dynamic programming algorithm to find the edit distance between two words.
